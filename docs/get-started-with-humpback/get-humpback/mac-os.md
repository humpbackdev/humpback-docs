## System Requirements

In order to install the Humpback generator in the right way, we require that the following packages are already installed in your system.

- Docker compose
- Docker CE
- composer
- node >= 6 (we recommend the usage of nvm)
- Yeoman
- brew (To install ahoy)
- ahoy >= 2


### Install the humpback generator:
To install the humpback generator we just need to execute the following command (Assuming that already installed Yeoman in a previews step).

```bash
npm install -g generator-humpback
```


And that's it, now you have humpback installed in your system.
