This is a proxy used to route request for given domain to nginx backend. To use it, you just need to have a .env file in the root of this folder with VIRTUAL_HOST variable set to any wanted domain. When you run ahoy up the magic will happen and you'll be able to open that domain in your browser and get your site. If you need more than one domain, set them in the same variable separated by comma.
