# Lighthouse

This is a tool created by Google. You can read the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/).

In order to use lighthouse in your project you need to run `ahoy site lighthouse` and optionally pass an argument for the url. Examples:

- `ahoy site lighthouse` (tests homepage)
- `ahoy site lighthouse /user/register` (tests register page)

Enjoy lighthouse!!!
